## Contact ##

For anything to do with Richard’s Parliamentary work, you can send messages to his official email address – allanr [AT] parliament.uk.

For messages related to anything else, please use this personal email address – hello [AT] ricallan.uk.

Please make your first paragraph a short, clear description of who you are and why you are getting in touch to help Richard prioritise anything important and/or urgent.

If you have contacts in common (LinkedIn is a good place to check if you do) then asking them to make the connection is also a good way to get through.

[NB please put key information in the text of the email rather than in an attached PDF ‘letter’.]
